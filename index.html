              <p>An experiment condcuted in an isolated enviroment (sources will be added later) has shown
              that nearly HALF of participants wouldn't be able to type out a sentence on a keyboard containing
              20 words in under a minute. </p> 
              <p>This shows that, despite how omnipotent technology is, we have to
              support our citizens in mastering it. It also might have left you with one question in mind... 
              The question is, <strong>can you do better?</strong> </p>
