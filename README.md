# SimpleWeb
A simple static web created for the purposes of my uni. The web's main function is to test user's typing skills
by containing a random word generator with a timer.

## Project status
The web is not meant to be taken as a serious project but as a fun way to test my basic front-end skills. I don't have any
plans on working on this project further.
